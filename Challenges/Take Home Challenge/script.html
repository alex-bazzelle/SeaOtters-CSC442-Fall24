    <p>Now im sure you must be thinking "oh this is not serious," or if your are smart you are thinking "Oh no what now?" I will
        tell you what now. With this information I am capable of endangering you by exposing what you have done both online and
        real life. I have been able to track you through you for months as you traveled back and forth to work. I know where you live.
        With this information I have the power to ruin your career. Did you really think you could be so careless online? I have watched you for 
        months without your knowledge.
        <br>
        But do not be concerned, there is a simple solution. You will send me a Apple gift card code for $200. This is all I ask to protect
        your career and job. You have 24 hours to do so. Failure to comply will result in your information being made public to all America. I 
        am a trustworthy person. Have faith in me and we will resolve this problem. Do not fret, it is a low price to pay for security.

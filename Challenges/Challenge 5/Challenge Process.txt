Coleman: I mostly spent my time troubleshooting our steg file, before realizing it was the terminal not correctly directing using '>'. I decrypted the life alert image to produce the cyber image and the constitution text. After the constitution text was found I attempted to decrypt it using steg but it was completed manually to get the secret passphrase.
Milo: I provided the timelock program. I ran the program for the challenge to get the time codes needed to get into the ftp server. 
Alex Bazzelle: I decrypted names of the first two files that we were provided. On the day of the challenge, I tried to figure out why the timelock program wasn't working. Eventually after class I found that I did not code the intervals correctly. Once I fixed that, I shared it with my team so that someone could find the files on the ftp server. I ran the XOR program to find the first hidden image. After my teammates used the steg program on the images, I looked into the constitution text. I discovered that the letters of the mispelled words created the passphrase.

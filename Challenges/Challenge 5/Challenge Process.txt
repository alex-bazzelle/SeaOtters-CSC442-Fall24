Coleman: I mostly spent my time troubleshooting our steg file, before realizing it was the terminal not correctly directing using '>'. I decrypted the life alert image to produce the cyber image and the constitution text. After the constitution text was found I attempted to decrypt it using steg but it was completed manually to get the secret passphrase.
